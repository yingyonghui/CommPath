\usage{
pathHeatmap(
  object,
  acti.path.dat = NULL,
  top.n.pathway = 10,
  path.order = "P.val.adj",
  col = NULL,
  cell.aver = FALSE,
  cell.label.size = NULL,
  cell.label.angle = 45,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{CommPath object}

\item{acti.path.dat}{Data frame of differential enrichment test result from diffAllPath; if NULL, diffAllPath would be run to get the acti.path.dat}

\item{top.n.pathway}{Show the heatmap of top n most significant pathways}

\item{path.order}{Sort criteria used to select the top n pathways, either 'P.val' or 'P.val.adj', which represent the original and adjusted p values, or 'diff' which represents the mean (in t test) or median (in wilcox test) difference}

\item{col}{Vector of colors used to generate a series of gradient colors to show the enrichment score of pathways; provide a vector containing at least two colors}

\item{cell.aver}{Whether to display averaged pathway enrichment scores among cells from the same clusters or to display scores for all cells; default is FALSE, which means to display scores for all cells}

\item{cell.label.size}{Text size of the label of cell types}

\item{cell.label.angle}{Rotation angle of the label of cell types}

\item{pathway.label.size}{Text size of the label of pathways}

\item{scale}{Whether to scale the enrichment sorces matrix among cells or not; default is TRUE}

\item{truncation}{Truncation fold value; scores > (the third quartiles + truncation * interquartile range) and scores < (the first quartiles - truncation * interquartile range) will be adjusted; either a value to indicate the specific truncation value or 'none' to indicate no truncation; default is 1.5}

\item{show.legend}{Whether to show the legend or not; default is FALSE}
